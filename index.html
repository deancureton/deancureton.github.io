				<p>I'm a student who will be attending Stanford University in the fall after having graduated from the Westminster Schools. Through summer tutoring, I hope to share my love of STEM subjects to younger kids and help prepare them for their upcoming studies during the school year.
				</p>
				<p>My coursework includes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Mathematics</b> - Algebra I and II, Geometry, Precalculus, AP Calculus BC, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Number Theory, Applied Combinatorics, Analysis I</li>
					<li><b>Computer Science</b> - Web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), Python, Java, C#</li>
					<li><b>Science</b> - AP Chemistry, AP Biology, AP Physics Mechanics, AP Physics Electricity & Magnetism</li>
				</ul>

							<p>One thing I've always disliked about middle and high school math curriculums is their strict adherence to formulaic problem solving methods. During my studies of advanced math at a young age, I was able to apply intuition and clever problem solving tricks that aren't taught in schools to complete work faster and keep math fun. Through tutoring, I hope to introduce younger kids to these methods that save precious time and keep math from being taught as a dry, formulaic subject.</p>

Driven by a curiosity of how they were made, I began programming incredibly simple games, and the satisfaction of bringing my own video game ideas to fruition fueled my passion even more. After having studied computer science for about ten years, I would love to be able to introduce curious young children to the world of programming and game development so that they, too, can find their own passion for invaluable computer science skills that are driving the future.

				<p>Through tutoring sessions, my goal is for students to improve their work efficiency and develop a passion for the subjects they study, helping make STEM more fun and easy. To do this, I hope to introduce students to tips and tricks that help them develop a strong problem solving intuition, something I believe that schools fail to teach. With these skills, STEM subjects become far less tedious and more natural to learn.</p>
