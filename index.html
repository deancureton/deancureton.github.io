				<p>I am a 2022 graduate of The Westminster Schools in Atlanta and will be attending Stanford University
					in the fall to study computer science and mathematics. Through summer tutoring and enrichment, I
					hope to share my love of STEM subjects with younger students and help them prepare for the upcoming
					school year.
				</p>
				<p>Classes I have taken over the course of my academic career include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Mathematics</b> - Algebra, Geometry, Precalculus, Trigonometry, AP Calculus BC, Multivariable
						Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Applied Combinatorics, and extensive study of
						Number Theory</li>
					<li><b>Computer Science</b> - Web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), Python, Java, C#</li>
					<li><b>Science</b> - AP Chemistry, AP Biology, AP Physics Mechanics, AP Physics Electricity &
						Magnetism</li>
				</ul>

							<p>One thing I've always disliked about middle and high school math curriculums is their strict adherence to formulaic problem solving methods. During my studies of advanced math at a young age, I was able to apply intuition and clever problem solving tricks that aren't taught in schools to complete work faster and keep math fun. Through tutoring, I hope to introduce younger kids to these methods that save precious time and keep math from being taught as a dry, formulaic subject.</p>

							<p>My love for computer science grew from an all too common childhood love of video games. Driven by a curiosity of how they were made, I began programming incredibly simple games, and the satisfaction of bringing my own video game ideas to fruition fueled my passion even more. After having studied computer science for about ten years, I would love to be able to introduce curious young children to the world of programming and game development so that they, too, can find their own passion for invaluable computer science skills that are driving the future.

				<p>Through tutoring and enrichment, my goal is for students to improve their work efficiency and develop
					a passion for the subjects they study. To do this, I hope to introduce students to techniques and
					principles that help them develop strong problem solving intuition. With these skills, STEM subjects
					become far less tedious and more natural to learn.</p>
